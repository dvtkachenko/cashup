# Using LoginFormSecurityConfig

# Authentication against the REST API – the URL for login is /login – and a simple curl command performing login would be:
# This request will return the Cookie which will then be used by any subsequent request against the REST Service

curl -i -X POST -d username=user -d password=password http://localhost:8080/login

# We can use curl to authentication and store the cookie it receives in a file:

curl -i -X POST -d username=user -d password=password -c d:/temp/cookies.txt http://localhost:8080/login

# Then we can use the cookie from the file to do further authenticated requests:

curl -i --header "Accept:application/json" -X GET -b d:/temp/cookies.txt http://localhost:8080/api/clients
